Short scripts to bring up Docker containers
===========================================

To start a Docker container often requires a long line of arguments to pass to the docker command. The scripts here capture the most often used parameters.

### Docker containers

* [Redis](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/redis)
* [MongoDB](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/mongo/)

### TODO

Use the [fig command](http://www.fig.sh) to completely replace the shells script with _yml_ configuration files.
